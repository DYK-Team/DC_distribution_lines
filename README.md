This repository is part of a student coursework aimed at understanding and simulating DC distribution lines. The project focuses on the analysis and calculation of currents, voltages, and power dissipation in a 2-wire DC distribution system fed from both ends. The repository includes both theoretical calculations and practical simulations using Python and LTspice.
